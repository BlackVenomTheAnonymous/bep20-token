The project idea, developed with researchers from University of Catania, is to build a platform that provides heterogeneous services specifically implemented on mobile devices.  
Central role in the project is covered by the development of a new core functionality that aims to create an indoor localization system capable of referring to customized maps using Arduino and Android.
```   

* <b>Semantic Sicily</b>   
``` 
Semantic Sicily partnership aims to develop research in the field of semantic web for a growing range of information to fit the needs of companies operating in different economic fields.  
The technological platform developed in the project is based on modern cloud computing technologies.  
The semantic core will be used as starting point for development of vertical application across a wide range of business sectors.  
These applications include e-learning, semantic document management, semantic network, voice recognition and text mining, real-time translation, reverse engineering, semantic web GIS, ERP, etc.
```

* <b>RESIMA</b>   
``` 
This project aims to develop a methodology based on the use of multi‐sensory architecture and computational intelligent paradigms to improve the indoor use of by the elderly and vulnerable people.  
The system will employ a network architecture in which nodes are multi‐sensory responsible for monitoring the location of users within the environment and the state of the environment.  
This will make it possible to estimate the user‐environment interaction and provide the necessary information for the visually impaired use a secure and efficient environment.
